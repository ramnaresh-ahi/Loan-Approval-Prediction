# Loan Approval Prediction using Logistic Regression

This project predicts loan approval status using a **Logistic Regression** model. It is designed to assist in decision-making by analyzing applicant data and identifying the likelihood of loan approval.

## 📁 Dataset
- The dataset includes key features such as applicant income, loan amount, credit history, and other relevant parameters.
- Cleaned and preprocessed for optimal model performance.

## 🔧 Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handled missing values and normalized data for better accuracy.
   - Transformed categorical data into numerical form.
2. **Data Analysis**:
   - Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and correlations.
3. **Model Training**:
   - Applied **Logistic Regression** to classify loan applications as approved or denied.
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets for evaluation.
4. **Prediction and Evaluation**:
   - Assessed model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Libraries**: 
  - **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data handling.
  - **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization.
  - **Scikit-learn** for building and evaluating the Logistic Regression model.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For development and experimentation.

## 📊 Key Insights
- Identified critical features affecting loan approval decisions.
- Demonstrated the utility of Logistic Regression for binary classification problems.
